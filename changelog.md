All notable changes to CLIMB-COVID APIs, data or interchange formats that have impact to users or other pipelines should be documented in this file.
Changes described here may only be a subset of all changes to a project as this log concerns itself only with changes that impact how data is provided or consumed by users or other pipelines.
The following DIPI projects are routinely using this CHANGELOG.

* `Majora API` -- metadata APIs
* `Ocarina` -- Majora command line client ([Full changelog](https://github.com/SamStudio8/ocarina/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))
* `Elan` -- inbound data pipeline
* `Tael` -- MQTT messaging tools
* `Asklepian` -- Outbound PHE pipeline
* `CLIMB-COVID` -- metaprojects (eg. status page, data page)

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

***
# 2021-05-26
## Datapipe
### Changed
* Renames metadata column `pillar_2` to `is_pillar_2` and changes value from True/False to Y/N to be consistent with incoming boolean columns
* Adds columns to consortium metadata
* Creates new metadata output `metadata/cog_global_<date>_epidemiology.csv` with a requested subset of columns with epi information in

***
# 2021-05-18
## CLIMB-COVID
### Added
* Added [data site](https://data.covid19.climb.ac.uk/) link to accession table ([#63](https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/63))

***
# 2021-05-14
## Tael
### Fixed
* [Patched](https://github.com/SamStudio8/elan-nextflow/commit/1ae6b713284130eb1ae1304c8416153bd10d4e7f) a regression in `mqtt-client.py` that caused clients not requiring any environment variables (`--envreq`) to silently fail to start their specified command
    * **Clients not specifying `--envreq` should be restarted as soon as possible**

***
# 2021-05-02
## Tael
### Added
* `mqtt-client.py` automatically subscribes clients to a "control topic" named `COGUK/infrastructure/pipelines/<who>/control`, where `who` is the name of the pipeline provided to `--who`
* Pipelines can now be manually raised by sending messages to the client control topic, specfying an `action` key with the value of `raise`

### Changed
* The `started` message emitted by `mqtt-client.py` now includes a `reason` key, explaining why the pipeline has started

***
# 2021-04-30
## Datapipe
### Changed
* Updated minimap2 sequence divergence threshold preset from 5% to 20% divergence as increasing numbers of (primarily GISAID) sequences were being lost from the MSA
* Passes `uk_lineage` metadata column through from previous datapipe run for use by phylopipe

***
# 2021-04-23
## Asklepian
### Changed
* [Genome table `Sequence` field is populated with MSA genome sequence rather than consensus sequence](https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/61)

***

# 2021-04-21
## Asklepian
### Added
* [New fields added to Genome table](https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/37)
    * Field `Adm1` added to Genome table
    * Field `Pillar` added to Genome table
    * Field `Published_date` added to Genome table

### Changed
* [Genome table is now delivered with `gzip` compression](https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/43)

***

# 2021-04-16
## CLIMB-COVID
### Added
* [CLIMB-COVID Status Page](https://status.covid19.climb.ac.uk/) is now automatically updated every day

***

# 2021-04-13
## Tael
### Added
* Payload keys targeted by `--envreq` are copied through to the output payload if `--envprefix` has not been provided. `--envprefix` still copies all payload keys to the output with the specified prefix.

### Changed
* Payload keys that will be passed through to the `finished` output payload will also be emitted in the `start` ouput payload

***

# 2021-04-12
## Majora API
### Changed
* [`ION_TORRENT` added to `instrument_make` validator](https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/46)
* [`103` added to `collection_pillar` validator](https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/48)

## Tael
### Added
* `--payload-passthrough` parameter allows keys from the input payload to be automatically copied to the `finished` output payload

***

# 2021-04-01
## Elan
### Changed
* [Elan will no longer sort uploaded BAMs](https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/39). User guidance has always been that BAMs should be sorted before uploaded so this step is a waste of compute resources and time. Unsorted BAMs will now be considered invalid and rejected by Elan as part of the quickcheck report.

***

# 2021-03-18
## Majora API
### Changed
* [`THERMO_AMPLITUDE` added to Ct `test_platform` validator](https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/36)
* [`TAQPATH_HT` added to Ct `test_kit` validator](https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/36)

***
# 2021-03-06
## DIPI
### Added
* Introduced this CHANGELOG to track notable changes to data and pipeline interchange formats. Significant changes before this date are out of the scope of this CHANGELOG.

## Elan
### Changed
* [Elan will now start at 6am each day and finish in the afternoon](https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/31).
